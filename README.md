# Genetic Algorthim
1. Create a N sized population of rockets, and give each of them a random gene sequence which is made from vectors.
2. After running a lifetime calculate the fitness of each member of the population according to their distance to the target and their reaach time.
3. Generate a mating pool according to the fitness.
4. Create a new popluation of N members with crossover gene sequence from random selected parents from the mating pool.
5. Apply mutations to new members.
6. Return to step 2 with new population.
